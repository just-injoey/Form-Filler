# Chrome Extension: Webpage Form Autofiller

This Chrome extension provides a convenient way to autofill web forms with pre-defined data. It saves time and effort by automatically populating fields such as name, email address, phone number, and more. With this extension, you can streamline your form filling process and improve your browsing experience.
